In the incremental model, we divide requirements In in the into standalone modules in different builds. As you can see in the picture above, there are four important phases in incremental development, which are requirements, design and development, testing, and implementation. For requirements, it must be completed before being divided into standalone modules, but if any additional modules or features are added or changed, we can change them before finishing each increment. For each build, we divide it by modules or features, so that coders or programmers can start doing their design and development because different modules or builds are not related to each other. Anyway, there will be some builds that have a relationship with each other, but not much, so if one build has an error, the build that is related to it will also be affected by it. We have to quickly realize the connection and handle it very quickly. After the programmers finish their development, they will go to another phase: the testing phase. It is the phase where they can test their development by checking the errors, debugging, and preparing it to be deployed in the implementation phase.
